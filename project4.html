							<h2>Experimental projects that explore my topic through a variety of media: image, sound, animation, drawing, sculpture, sketches of interactive systems. </h2>
							
							<br>

							<h2>Day 1</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								Using biometric data to understand and connect with other living beings. 
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>
								I was inspired by how other animals could sense feelings and their surroundings more acutely than humans could, and I want to find a way to find the missing biometric data 
								that could transmit those feelings. I have very little idea on what I want this week’s prototypes to be, but I know that the first project will most likely set the tone and 
								inspire the rest of the prototypes to come, so I decided to take a more ambitious approach to make something physical, but in a style that is comfortable to me. For this project 
								I was inspired by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s Pulse tank project, where the light reflected on the walls are from the simulations of waves of people’s heartbeats. I want to create a simulation 
								that would attract and benefit both adults and children alike, and thus I drew my vectors in a very rounded and whimsical style. 
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							
							<p> The project is used to simulate an interactive experience between humans and dolphins, where the biometric data between the two species could be shared and thus communicate more effectively. 
								The ripples of water and body temperature of the participants within the space would be recorded and translated into more dynamic human language for better understanding amongst humans, and 
								then the human responses would be transmitted back to the dolphins through ripples within the waters, creating a full communicative circle.

							<h2>Day 2</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							《<p>Still laser cutting it rn TBD</p>
							<h3>Process</h3>
							<h3>Concept</h3>

							<h2>Day 3</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								Document your day and record any ways that biometric data benefits you.
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>
								Today we visited the material conneXions lab, and I want to create a prototype that would include some visuals to document the day, and thus today’s prototype is a video diary of everything I did today and 
								record my interactions with machines and biometric data that enhanced our daily lives. 
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>
								Through documenting the day, I realized that my activities are largely surrounded by the time rather than the specific tasks that I aimed to achieve in the day, and thus I included timestamps on every major activity. 
								I also noticed the numerous times where we need to scan into places (office buildings, dorms, subways), and we always need to have a sort of identification present due to the pandemic, but none of which is an actual 
								secure way to identify ourselves and could be easily manipulated.

							<h2>Day 4</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								Explore the relationship between people and their own biometric data, and how that relationship could benefit change their personal rights and lifestyles.
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>Today I decided to experiment with a more hands-on approach to prototyping. I started off by using some copic markers and gel pens to illustrate different biometric data from nature. From there, I was inspired by how we associate a sense of calm and 
							   serenity from looking at greenery, and want to create something that would enhance positive feelings by recognizing and understanding the feelings that we are trying to process.
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>Bio pen that could help its users recognize their feelings and emotions by gathering biometric data such as body temperature, movement, heart beat, and eye movement. The pen is often used to draw and write and to reflect our emotions, and with the rapid 
							   digitization of our work spaces, it remains as a way for us to connect to physical materials and the physical world. The Bio pen can function as a tool that can help us write and understand our own emotions. It could be applied to people who experienced 
							   trauma, people that are battling mental illnesses, children learning to express themselves, or anyone who wishes to understand their own feelings better.
