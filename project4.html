							<h2>Day 1</h2>
							
							<p> I have very little idea on what I want this week’s prototypes to be, but I know that the first project will most likely set the tone and inspire the rest of the prototypes 
								to come, so I decided to take a more ambitious approach to make something physical, but in a style that is comfortable to me. For this project I was inspired by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s 
								Pulse tank project, where the light reflected on the walls are from the simulations of waves of people’s heartbeats. I want to create a simulation that would attract and benefit both adults 
								and children alike, and thus I drew my vectors in a very rounded and whimsical style. The project is used to simulate an interactive experience between humans and dolphins, where the biometric 
								data between the two species could be shared and thus communicate more effectively. The ripples of water and body temperature of the participants within the space would be recorded and translated 
								into more dynamic human language for better understanding amongst humans, and then the human responses would be transmitted back to the dolphins through ripples within the waters, creating a full communicative circle.

							<h2>Day 2</h2>

							<p>
								Today we visited the material conneXions lab, and I want to create a prototype that would include some visuals to document the day, and thus today’s prototype is a video diary of everything I did today 
								and record my interactions with machines and biometric data that enhanced our daily lives. Through documenting the day, I realized that my activities are largely surrounded by the time rather than the 
								specific tasks that I aimed to achieve in the day, and thus I included timestamps on every major activity. I also noticed the numerous times where we need to scan into places (office buildings, dorms, 
								subways), and we always need to have a sort of identification present due to the pandemic, but none of which is an actual secure way to identify ourselves and could be easily manipulated.
