							<h2>Experimental projects that explore my topic through a variety of media: image, sound, animation, drawing, sculpture, sketches of interactive systems. </h2>
							
							<br>

							<h2>Day 1</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								Using biometric data to understand and connect with other living beings. 
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>
								I was inspired by how other animals could sense feelings and their surroundings more acutely than humans could, and I want to find a way to find the missing biometric data 
								that could transmit those feelings. I have very little idea on what I want this week’s prototypes to be, but I know that the first project will most likely set the tone and 
								inspire the rest of the prototypes to come, so I decided to take a more ambitious approach to make something physical, but in a style that is comfortable to me. For this project 
								I was inspired by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s Pulse tank project, where the light reflected on the walls are from the simulations of waves of people’s heartbeats. I want to create a simulation 
								that would attract and benefit both adults and children alike, and thus I drew my vectors in a very rounded and whimsical style. 
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							
							<p> The project is used to simulate an interactive experience between humans and dolphins, where the biometric data between the two species could be shared and thus communicate more effectively. 
								The ripples of water and body temperature of the participants within the space would be recorded and translated into more dynamic human language for better understanding amongst humans, and 
								then the human responses would be transmitted back to the dolphins through ripples within the waters, creating a full communicative circle.
							</p>

							<h2>Day 2</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								Provide an immersive experience that is created with biometric data
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>If digital data could be stored in DNA with no repercussions on storage space, then we could document data in a scale that is more in depth than ever before, and be fully able to recreate a memory or a space. 
								
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>If digital data could be stored in DNA with no repercussions on storage space, then we could document data in a scale that is more in depth than ever before, and be fully able to recreate a memory or space. Much like the VR games 
								that we have today, this prototype aims to explore the possibility to recreate a space for users to fully relive a memory or recreate a space. The place that I chose to represent in this prototype is a block of the ocean. Ocean 
								patterns can be highly unpredictable and volatile, and thus would be a great space to showcase the amount of data that is possible to be saved and easily utilized. This type of application could be used to study patterns within 
								nature, or create an ultra immersive experience for recreational or educational purposes. 
							</p>


							<h2>Day 3</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								Document your day and record any ways that biometric data benefits you.
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>
								Today we visited the material conneXions lab, and I want to create a prototype that would include some visuals to document the day, and thus today’s prototype is a video diary of everything I did today and 
								record my interactions with machines and biometric data that enhanced our daily lives. 
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>
								Through documenting the day, I realized that my activities are largely surrounded by the time rather than the specific tasks that I aimed to achieve in the day, and thus I included timestamps on every major activity. 
								I also noticed the numerous times where we need to scan into places (office buildings, dorms, subways), and we always need to have a sort of identification present due to the pandemic, but none of which is an actual 
								secure way to identify ourselves and could be easily manipulated. 
							</p>

							<h2>Day 4</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								Explore the relationship between people and their own biometric data, and how that relationship could benefit change their personal rights and lifestyles.
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>Today I decided to experiment with a more hands-on approach to prototyping. I started off by using some copic markers and gel pens to illustrate different biometric data from nature. From there, I was inspired by how we associate a sense of calm and 
							   serenity from looking at greenery, and want to create something that would enhance positive feelings by recognizing and understanding the feelings that we are trying to process.
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>Bio pen that could help its users recognize their feelings and emotions by gathering biometric data such as body temperature, movement, heart beat, and eye movement. The pen is often used to draw and write and to reflect our emotions, and with the rapid 
							   digitization of our work spaces, it remains as a way for us to connect to physical materials and the physical world. The Bio pen can function as a tool that can help us write and understand our own emotions. It could be applied to people who experienced 
							   trauma, people that are battling mental illnesses, children learning to express themselves, or anyone who wishes to understand their own feelings better.

							<h2>Day 5</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								Utilize ways in which biometric data could benefit individual 
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>TI wanted to dig deeper from yesterday’s prototype, which is a tool that would benefit the user by using biometric data, and so today I decided to render out a different product. I used maya to 3D model the cutteries, 
								and then I did some simple rotation animation for them. To save time, I animated the blinking lights using photoshop, and turned the animation into a gif. 
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>Enchanted cuttery is a set of cuttery aimed to help identify the ingredients in the food that we intake. Each cuttery would have multiple sensors that indicates how well the meal fits into the predetermined nutrition plan 
								that the users defined, and if any allergens were present in the food. The blinking lights have 5 levels of ratings, with the green being the best rating for a well balanced dish that fits the predetermined nutritional plans, 
								and red being the least fitting rate. If allergens are present, then all the lights would turn red and the utensils would vibrate to warn the user. To make the utensils more accessible, there would be different sound indications 
								of each of the 5 levels of ratings and the red warning rating for allergens as well. 
							</p>

							<h2>Day 6</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>
								DNA storage systems that are easily accessible and easily transported
							</p>

							<h3>Process</h3>
							<p>Our limited digital storage is becoming a problem as data storage is expensive and takes up a lot of space. Our easy way out to dump our data is through the cloud, but even with the cloud there are just a bunch of really 
								big hard drives that are stored somewhere you don’t see. If we convert digital data into our DNA however, we could store all the data that ever existed with ease. According to Scientific America, “humanity will generate 
								an estimated 33 zettabytes of data by 2025—that’s 3.3 followed by 22 zeroes. DNA storage can squeeze all that information into a ping-pong ball, with room to spare.” I think with the advancing technologies, our ways of 
								storing data are bound to change, and right now it is heading into the direction of DNA. I think data could be approached in a very poetic way, which is viewing data as our memories, as something that makes us, us. With 
								the accessible DNA storage for data, we no longer have to prioritize our data and decide what is important enough to keep in order to save space. We are humans and humans make mistakes, we don’t always know what would be 
								important to us at the fleeting moments, and not having to worry about storage is a luxury we don’t all have right now. Other than the rigidity and emphasis on the functionality that is usually associated with technology 
								and data, today I decided to take a more organic route and use clay to mold the prototype to represent something that would still be a part of us, but would be able to help us function better. 
								
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>Storing data into DNA is not as complex as it sounds, and it is done so by converting photos or videos into bits, and each pixel would be a number. The numbers from the data are then converted into ACGT in DNA. The current 
								method to retrieve the messages within the DNA, you send it to a lab to sequence it. The downside of this is that there is a small margin of error when recovering the messages, and the DNA would be destroyed. A way to counter 
								that is to duplicate multiple copies of the same DNA so that one could retrieve it more than once. But what if we could treat the bio data the same as we do with digital data? This prototype explores the idea that our personal 
								data would be embedded into our iris, and it could be transmitted via eye drops. We could be able to organize our core data, such as our social security and health records into our irises, and be able to organize our everyday, 
								“ephemeral” data, such as our homework and snapchats into dna strands in contact solutions.

							<h2>Day 7</h2>
							<br>
							<h3>Idea</h3>
							<p>Biometric ID Cards</p>
							<h3>Process</h3>

							<p>I was studying the idea of digital identity and how biometric data would potentially interfere with your personal rights, and from there I studied biometric security systems. Currently we have retina 
							and fingerprint to ensure the security of our phones, and it has proven to be quite effective, so I wanted to take it to the next step. I used Adobe Illustrator to create all of the digital files, and 
							used the laser cutter and acrylic paints to add finishing touches to the prototype. 
							</p>

							<h3>Concept</h3>
							<p>An universal key card that is activated with your retina or fingerprint, and is able to manage all of security and identity needs. This card would replace all other cards by being able to store all digitaal 
							credentials and codes that your credit cards and security keys have. The idea is that there would be a small laser scanner on the card that would be able to scan all of your pre-existing cards to obtain all 
							the credentials, and then you would be able to update the card with new info via traditional methods as well.
