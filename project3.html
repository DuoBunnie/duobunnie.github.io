							<h1 class="major">Midterm Personal Reflection</h1>
							<h2>An honest reflection and what I plan to do moving forward.</h2>
							<p> I am very inspired by all the wonderful feedback that I received from my peers and critiques during the Midterm presentation, 
								and I think I gained lots of new momentum and ideas to further research in. All of my peers responded positively to the type 
								of research that I was showing, but they were also confused by the main topics of my research. I think moving forward, I would 
								try to present my ideas and interests in a more developmental order so that the audience with no prior knowledge of my research 
								would grasp a better understanding. I have many interests and I definitely tried to fit too much of my research into the short 8 
								minute presentation, and I believe that has a lot to do with the way I research as well. I had no idea how to go off with my interest 
								in biometric data and the relationship between machines and humans in the very beginning, and my way of tackling the issue is to list 
								down ideas and topics that are of interest to me. This type of non linear way of research led to a broader sense of topics than I expected, 
								and from all of the extensive research in numerous topics, I was able to find different things that furthered my interests. I started off 
								with simple biometrics and data gathering to AI and privacy and personal rights. I understood that I had too many research topics that 
								seemed shattered to everyone else but me, and thus I started my presentation with goals and alignments of me as a designer rather than 
								a single solidifying question, because to be honest, I don’t have one yet. Everytime I dig deeper into my topics I feel like I know less, 
								and there are more things to be learned. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Another big question that I am trying to tackle at the moment is the question why. The critiques were kind enough to give me encouragement 
								in the interest of my topics, but they also brought up the idea of why my topic is important in the first place, and whether it is a question 
								that is needed. I am trying to discover it myself as well as to why I want to investigate the idea between art and AI, and I think I am trying 
								too hard to connect all of my interests together that I somehow lost sight of the fundamental question, which is whether my question of AI generated 
								art would be necessary in the first place. I am currently taking a break from further research in the AI generated art topic, and trying to understand 
								my other questions associated with biometric data. I think the question of whether ai should interfere with personal rights is a very good discussion point, 
								and I want to further develop that question.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the upcoming 7 for 7, I plan to make various ways that one may experience biometric data and experiment with different materials, and possibly make some 
								imaginative prototype  videos/ photographs. I think due to the nature of my topic, material choice could be quite tricky because people may have different expectations 
								and varying levels of trust to different material representations. I currently am having trouble identifying ways in which I can represent data and personal rights, but 
								I am thinking somewhere along the lines of using laser engraved acrylics and light to illuminate things that are “hidden.” To further my work, I believe that more interviews 
								and research papers may help, but I also just want to get my hands on some materials and start creating prototypes right away. I think a different way to manifest my research 
								could be a data visualization project, or an imaginative product that protects your personal data. I think I want to experiment with both physical and digital prototypes. For 
								digital, I can make short animations or videos or 3D art. I have used maya and blender before, and I think this is a good time to pick up some old skills and use them to make 
								prototypes. For the physical component, I would like to play with more wood and acrylics because I think those materials can represent the future and the past. I want to have 
								two juxtaposing materials, ones that may be the opposite of each other either by association or physical attributes. I think that the art of the 21st century can be represented 
								with imagery, sound, as well as text, and that moving forward, AI may very well become a prominent tool to help artists express themselves, and become a common fourth medium for art in the future.
