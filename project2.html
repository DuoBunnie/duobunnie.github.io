							<h2>Inspirations</h2>

							<h3>Studio Swine x COS</h3>

							</span>
							<p>
								“Studio Swine has released a movie revealing its Milan design week installation for COS – a tree-like structure that emits pale white bubbles, which dissolve 
								into pale white mist as they burst. The London-based duo – Japanese designer Azusa Murakami and British designer Alexander Groves – wanted their installation to 
								be reminiscent of cherry blossom trees. Called New Spring, the six-metre high structure consists of slender tubes that extend up and out like the branches of a 
								tree. Large translucent bubbles emerge from the ends of each branch. These bubbles burst when they come into contact with skin, but not when they touch textured 
								fabrics – meaning visitors can handle them with gloves. As they burst, a pale mist is released. Like many of Studio Swine's past projects – which include accessories 
								made from hair and furniture produced from ocean plastic – the installation is an exploration of unusual materials.” -Dezeen

							<h3>Rafael Lozano-Hemmer</h3>

							<p>
								"Known for incorporating technology and design into his artwork, Mexican-Canadian artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer is exhibiting his immersive public art installations together 
								for the first time under one roof at Washington, D.C.’s Hirshhorn Museum. In the exhibit, called Pulse, which closes at the end of the week, Lozano-Hemmer uses interactive 
								technology to interpret the vital signs of visitors. Biometric signatures–fingerprints, heartbeats–of each visitor are recorded as repetitive sequences and translated into 
								immersive sound experiences, waves in water tanks, and flashing lights. In the first piece in the exhibit, Pulse Index, participants’ fingerprints and heart rates are recorded 
								via a custom-made sensor and displayed along with the fingerprints of the past 10,000 participants on a grid, pulsating to their heartbeat. In Pulse Tank, participants’ heartbeats 
								are turned into ripples in an illuminated water tank, creating patterns that are then reflected on gallery walls. In the last piece in the exhibit, Pulse Room, rows of light bulbs 
								hang from the ceiling and pulsate to the rhythm of the heartbeats of past visitors. As more visitors pass through, the heartbeats travel down the row until it ends." -Syasmin Gagne

							<h2>Topic of Interest</h2>
							<p>
								My project started off with my interest in biometric data. Through there I explored the history of human interaction design and the influences of the different types of biometric data. 
								With biometric data being divided into 3 main categories, physical biometrics, behavioral biometrics, and chemical biometrics, I began to investigate what truly interested me in each of 
								the categories. Studio Swine x COS collaboration in 2017, I was very intrigued by the way people behave around the “bubbles.” The dark room and bright bubbles had stark contrast against 
								each other, and yet communicated a very playful and whimsical atmosphere. Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s works are also very inspiring as he presented data in such a way that it became an immersive 
								experience that can be interpreted easily by others.

							<h2>Interview 1: Scott Tarlow</h2>
							<p>
								Scott Tarlow is a data scientist at an AI consulting firm called Hypergiant. I was interested in how Scott perceives his work and his influence on his projects, and how they represent the current 
								industry that he is in. When it comes to biometric data, one of the main ways which they could be applied is healthcare and security, and I want to get a data scientist's insight on how they believe 
								the shift in the industry would be.
