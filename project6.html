							<h2>Concept</h2>
							<p>
								I was inspired by how other animals could sense feelings and their surroundings more acutely than humans could, and I want to find a way to find the missing biometric data 
								that could transmit those feelings. I have very little idea on what I want this week’s prototypes to be, but I know that the first project will most likely set the tone and 
								inspire the rest of the prototypes to come, so I decided to take a more ambitious approach to make something physical, but in a style that is comfortable to me. For this project 
								I was inspired by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer’s Pulse tank project, where the light reflected on the walls are from the simulations of waves of people’s heartbeats. I want to create a simulation 
								that would attract and benefit both adults and children alike, and thus I drew my vectors in a very rounded and whimsical style.
