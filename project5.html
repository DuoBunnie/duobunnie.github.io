							<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
							<p>
								I am interested in how biometric data could shape and change our views and lifestyles. I believe that we are almost at the point of the digital age where we can finally reap the benefits of mass data collection, 
								whether it's personal data or metadata. I see data as another medium of communication and expression, and thus I view it as a way of art as well. I am especially intrigued by the personal qualities of biometric 
								data and how we can utilize them to understand ourselves and others better. That being said, it’s important to see that there is also an underlying emphasis on the personal and security ramifications of massive 
								data collection that cannot be ignored. For example, collecting health data may lead to freedoms in traveling and identification, but it could also be invasive in one’s personal rights. Should one’s health data be 
								public data to collect, then we could collectively tackle health problems, but it would also mean that one’s medical history could become public information. I believe that we are reaching an age where we have to 
								face the question of whether we should use the data to reflect society or use the data to manipulate the society that we want, and I would like to explore the ladder in more depth.  
							</p>
							<p>
								My primary research question revolves around the relationship between people and their own biometric data, and how data could benefit and shape our daily lives. My work consists of Wizards of Oz prototypes that are 
								built upon the research that allowed digital data to be encoded into DNA molecules. My works are intended to be exploratory solutions that blur the boundaries of the imaginiatives and the possibilities made possible 
								by the new technologies, and aim to explore the idea of how we want our data to shape the future.
