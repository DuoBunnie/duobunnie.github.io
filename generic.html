							<h2> Connecting Strangers</h2>
							<p>An interactive project in New York city to engage strangers without text or any set of instructions.	</p>
							<br>
							<h2> Location</h2>
							<p> One of the many unique aspects of New York City is the embedded green spaces that are sectioned off from the rest of the concrete jungle buildings. 
								We knew that we wanted to use a park space for our project because of our common interest in nature, and we ultimately chose Washington Square park 
								due to its close proximity to campus, and it's beautiful arch, fountain, and unique layout.
							</p>
							
							<h2> Design Research</h2>
							<p>We walked around the park and carefully recorded what we saw and where we saw it. We noticed that other than the intensional division of the park by 
								its properties and roads, there is also a clear division between the people that gather around the park, noticeably the homeless people.
								We want to connect people of different groups and ages that are within the park proximity, and to create something that can be enjoyed by everyone.  
							<p>
							<p>
								During our time at the park we also interviewed a young vendor. We found her on the benches at the east side of the fountain, and she informed us that 
								she comes to the park on most days and nights to sell ice cold water, soda, and other refreshments.
								She also says that she knows many of the other vendors and folks who frequent the park, such as police officers (who were mostly there for show), 
								parks workers, addicts, and homeless people.

							<h2>Our Concept</h2>
							<p>Our concept is to connect the people of different communities that reside within the park through 
								fun and whimsical interactions. To do so, we chose a medium that can travel distance, and able to be 
								enjoyed by people of all ages, BUBBLES! Ultimately we want bubble machines to be disguised in different 
								structures within the park. It would be a very cute and decorative approach where bubble machines could 
								be covered up amongst some playful objects that we make ourselves, like iridescent, geometric sculptures 
								made of translucent films, or, it would be from a curious approach as well. Since people tend to approach 
								things that intrigue them curiously, it would be a fun idea to put bubble machines in unlikely places, 
								such as inside trash cans, hidden among bushes and trees, or inside stuffed animals that we leave around the park. 
							</p>

							<p>Before we spend too much resources getting actual bubble machines, we want to test the range of reach for the bubbles 
								in different locations, and see how people would react them. We plan to hang up webs with loops on them, and dip them in soapy 
								water to see if the area is windy enough to produce bubbles on its own and let it travel across the park.

                	 		<h1>Prototype 1.1 Interface for interaction</h1>
							<p>	
								A shared canvas made up of fabric, where strangers and passerbys can contribute to a shared piece of art, while 
								still maintaining a safe and comfortable distance. The canvas portion is made up by strining thrifted white shirts
								on a metal wire. Inside this wired contraption we placed a small stand on bubble machine. The location made it difficult
								to find a stable space to place the installation, so we strung the final contraction on a thread that is tied to a lamppost
								and a tree branch next to a crowded seating area. This point of interaction should provide opportunities for 
								person-to-person, person-to-group, and person-to-public. We hope that this installation will culminate in a 
								lasting artifact, created by the collective curiosity and joy of park-goers. 
							</p>

							<h2>Prototype 1.1 Reflection</h2>
							<p>
								This is the first time we gathered as a group and physically went out together to put up the prototype, and we were able to 
								obtain lots of visual and physical information that we did not think of before, such as the relationship between our materials of 
								choice and the location, and how the bubbles could possible be an obstruction to some of the people at the park. This exhibition test
								is a big turning point in our project, where we decided to focus on what we are actually interested in rather than what we want to do. 
								We completely scratched the idea of letting people paint the fabric with the bubble gun completely on the spot and didn't even try to execute
								the idea because we saw a few people wave the bubbles away, and also realized that the food color in the bubbles may be hard to remove on
								some unconventional fabrics. 
								<br>
								There are two parts of this prototype exhibiton, where we tested to see the affects of the bubbles, and the outcome surprised us in terms of
								how a simple material such as bubbles could drastically change the entire feel of the instellation. Without the bubbles, the white shirts hung on
								a string somehow blended in the park enviroment a little too perfectly, where it looked like it really belonged there as laundry or just discarded 
								materials. With the addition of bubbles however, it looked like it is purposeflly placed there, and added an uncanny contrast and humor to the project. 

								For the next prototype, we plan to fix some of the issues that we observed during the exhibit:
								<li>Relocate to a more central and open area that is exposed to more traffic and won't obstruct traffic</li>
								<li>Add writing utensils on the installation itslef so people can easily access the materials</li>
								<li>Take away the color from the bubbles</li>
								<li>Add interest points to attract attention without distrubting others</li>
								<li>Secure the installation on a platform</li>
							</p>

							<h2>Prototype 1.2 Interface for interaction</h2>
							<p>
								In this prototype, we used a semi-opaque acrylic board material to use as a canvas, and se secured the board on a camera stand to elevate the whole board to eyelevel.
								The board itself is painted with organic shapes to encourage the users to use their imagination to interpret what is shown, and it allows them 
								to draw what they see on the board.
							</p>

							<h2>Prototype 1.2 Reflection</h2>
							<P>This project really surprised us on how successfully we were able to gain attention and interaction amongst strangers with such a simple concept.
								The most trouble we had was taking the actual project down because there was a constant flow of people who are interested, and we did not want to 
								interrupt their experience with our project. The additon of color and more organic forms really enhanced the intsallation as a point of interest, 
								and the various different sides of the board gave more freedom to those who came to draw.
