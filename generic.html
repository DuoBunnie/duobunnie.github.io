							<h2> Connecting Strangers</h2>
							<p>An interactive project in New York city to engage strangers without text or any set of instructions.	</p>
							<br>
							<h2> Location</h2>
							<p> One of the many unique aspects of New York City is the embedded green spaces that are sectioned off from the rest of the concrete jungle buildings. 
								We knew that we wanted to use a park space for our project because of our common interest in nature, and we ultimately chose Washington Square park 
								due to its close proximity to campus, and it's beautiful arch, fountain, and unique layout.
							</p>
							
							<h2> Design Research</h2>
							<p>We walked around the park and carefully recorded what we saw and where we saw it. We noticed that other than the intensional division of the park by 
								its properties and roads, there is also a clear division between the people that gather around the park, noticeably the homeless people.
								We want to connect people of different groups and ages that are within the park proximity, and to create something that can be enjoyed by everyone.  
							<p>
							<p>
								During our time at the park we also interviewed a young vendor. We found her on the benches at the east side of the fountain, and she informed us that 
								she comes to the park on most days and nights to sell ice cold water, soda, and other refreshments.
								She also says that she knows many of the other vendors and folks who frequent the park, such as police officers (who were mostly there for show), 
								parks workers, addicts, and homeless people.

							<h2>Our Concept</h2>
							<p>Our concept is to connect the people of different communities that reside within the park through 
								fun and whimsical interactions. To do so, we chose a medium that can travel distance, and able to be 
								enjoyed by people of all ages, BUBBLES! Ultimately we want bubble machines to be disguised in different 
								structures within the park. It would be a very cute and decorative approach where bubble machines could 
								be covered up amongst some playful objects that we make ourselves, like iridescent, geometric sculptures 
								made of translucent films, or, it would be from a curious approach as well. Since people tend to approach 
								things that intrigue them curiously, it would be a fun idea to put bubble machines in unlikely places, 
								such as inside trash cans, hidden among bushes and trees, or inside stuffed animals that we leave around the park. 
							</p>

							<p>Before we spend too much resources getting actual bubble machines, we want to test the range of reach for the bubbles 
								in different locations, and see how people would react them. We plan to hang up webs with loops on them, and dip them in soapy 
								water to see if the area is windy enough to produce bubbles on its own and let it travel across the park.
							</p>

                	 		<h2>Interface for interaction</h2>
							<p>	
								A shared canvas or making surface, where strangers and passerbys can contribute to a shared piece of art, while 
								still maintaining a safe and comfortable distance. This point of interaction should provide opportunities for 
								person-to-person, person-to-group, and person-to-public. We hope that this installation will culminate in a 
								lasting artifact, created by the collective curiosity and joy of park-goers.
							</p>

							<h2>Materials</h2>
							<p>1. Interface
								<li>Canvas / surface to make on</li>
								<li>Easel</li>	
								<li>Various types of bubble makers</li>
								<li>Different colored bubble solutions</li>
								<li>Eventually, podiums to mount each bubble maker in front of the making surface</li>
							</p>
							<p>2. Wayfinding / indicators
								<li>Colored indicators around the podiums ("personal bubbles," if you will)</li>
								<li>Perhaps, if more clarity is necessary, further indicators on the park grounds</li>	
							</p>
